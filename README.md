# IMPORTANT NOTE

The CSS-only menu is buggy, not to mention the technique is hacky. If you want to use a circular menu on your page / in your app, I recommend using SVG.

To make and download a ready-to-use SVG circular menu, use [this tool](http://sarasoueidan.com/tools/circulus).

*Since SVG is a much better and more semantic alternative, I will no longer be maintaining this menu or fixing issues that come up with it.*
